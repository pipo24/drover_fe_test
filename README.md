Drover FE Test - Manchester Landing Page
=============


Task
-------------
- Build the attached landing page designs "Landing_page_Manchester_desktop.png"
- Build good and reusable code and think about components not just one-off style
- Get as far as you can. Don't stress about not finishing
- Use a FE library if you want. (We use http://getbootstrap.com)
- Try making it fully responsive
- Don't need to build Footer or Google Reviews sections (see below)
- Form can be static (cool if you use jQuery to make it do something on submit - if you have time)

-------------
If you have more than 3h to try this then try building:
- google reviews section
- the footer
- submit the form and return a message of some kind to the user
